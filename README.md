## Running Tests

I was having difficulties getting mysql to work, and class is almost over, I opted to finish a second pending project as opposed to figure out how to get the video. I apologize for any inconviences this may cause and am hoping just for a passing grade to put this assignment behind me. Thank you for your time!
